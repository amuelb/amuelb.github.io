			<h1>AMY BROWN</h1>
			<h2>Graphic Designer, 19</h2>
			<p>I have been passionate about art for as long as I can remember... I used to sit around for hours and do little crafty things like model cars, drawings, cards, oragami, photography, and little bead creatures. I lived and breathed art.</p>
			<p>Going through shcool, it was obvious where my dreams were headed since I did everything I could to take any art based program that was offered. I graduated with around 12 art credits and seven media/visual art based awards.</p>
			<p>Currently, I study the graphic arts full time and work in a high-end wedding photography studio down in the Glebe. After I finish here, I plan to move to Toroto and persue a fulltime career as a designer. </p>
